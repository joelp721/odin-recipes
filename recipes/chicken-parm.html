    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This variant of the classic italian chicken parmesan has <em>less</em> sauce and a <strong>crispier</strong> crust. 
        One of the biggest mistakes that is commonly made with homemade chicken parmesan is many recipes often use too much sauce, leading to a soggy crust with poor texture. 
        This is mitigated by adding sauce to the top of the chicken cutlet and not the bottom. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

    <h3><em>Chef's Tip</em></h3>
            <p>Use high quality prepared tomato sauce for a better end result. You may
            substitute pesto or dried italian herbs of your choice for basil, or omit entirely
            </p>
